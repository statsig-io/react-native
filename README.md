> All users of the `statsig-react-native` npm package should migrate to the `@statsig/react-native-bindings` package for bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. See [these docs](https://docs.statsig.com/client/javascript-sdk/react-native) to get started.

The Statsig SDK for React Native (non Expo) applications. Note that if you're using Expo, use [https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native-expo](https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native-expo) instead. If you need a SDK for another language or server environment, check out our [other SDKs](https://docs.statsig.com/#sdks).

Statsig helps you move faster with Feature Gates (Feature Flags) and Dynamic Configs. It also allows you to run A/B tests to validate your new features and understand their impact on your KPIs. If you're new to Statsig, create an account at [statsig.com](https://www.statsig.com).
